You will make it through this day,
deep inside I know that you will.
Just tell yourself you're not giving up,
keep moving and never stand still.
 
Breathe in the fresh air you feel,
keep your head to the sky and never look down.
Be one with the universe all around you,
listen to the birds and their magical sound.
 
You're almost there my friend,
keep climbing and believe in yourself.
leave your tears and anxieties behind you, 
put your worries and doubts upon the highest shelf.
